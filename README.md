## Introduction

XTTS V2 is designed to provide high-quality text-to-speech synthesis. By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning, it aims to deliver natural and expressive speech outputs. The project supports various languages and allows users to customize their models using their own datasets.

## Features

- **Coqui TTS Integration**: Built on the Coqui TTS framework, ensuring robust performance.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Easily train models on your own datasets.
- **Fine-Tuning Capabilities**: Optimize models for specific applications.
- **PEFT LORA**: Utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques.
- **Multiple Language Support**: Create TTS models for different languages.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverage pre-trained models for faster training.

## Installation

To get started with XTTS V2, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Degon3399/XTTS_V2.git
   cd XTTS_V2
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries for audio processing.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using XTTS V2 for your TTS needs. Here’s a simple example to get you started:

```python
from xtts import XTTS

# Initialize the model
model = XTTS(model_name="your_model_name")

# Generate speech from text
speech = model.synthesize("Hello, world!")
speech.save("output.wav")
```

## Training

Training a model with XTTS V2 is straightforward. You can use your own dataset or the provided example datasets. Here’s how to initiate training:

1. Prepare your dataset in the required format.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path your_dataset_path --model_name your_model_name
   ```

3. Monitor the training process through the logs.

## Custom Datasets

Custom datasets can significantly enhance the performance of your TTS model. Follow these guidelines to prepare your dataset:

- Ensure that your audio files are in a supported format (e.g., WAV).
- Create a corresponding text file that matches the audio files.
- Organize your dataset into a structured format, such as:
  ```
  dataset/
      audio/
          file1.wav
          file2.wav
      metadata.txt
  ```

## Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning allows you to adapt a pre-trained model to your specific needs. To fine-tune a model, follow these steps:

1. Load the pre-trained model.
2. Use your custom dataset for training.
3. Run the fine-tuning script:
   ```bash
   python fine_tune.py --pretrained_model your_model_name --data_path your_custom_dataset
   ```

## PEFT LORA

PEFT LORA (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is a technique that allows for efficient model adaptation with fewer parameters. This method reduces the computational cost and speeds up the training process. To use PEFT LORA:

1. Enable the PEFT option in your training script.
2. Specify the layers to fine-tune.

## Multiple Language Support

XTTS V2 supports multiple languages, allowing you to create diverse TTS models. To add a new language:

1. Collect audio samples in the target language.
2. Prepare the dataset as outlined in the Custom Datasets section.
3. Train the model using the specified language parameters.
